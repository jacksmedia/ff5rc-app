v2.07
Bugfix by clymax to correct the "Double" patch (2x ABP, Exp, Gil) authored by C_CliFF and clymax.

v2.06
Fixes some labels in the Menu system & makes "Best" into Best (by Gens).

v2.05
adds missing bugfixes! (from Inu's trove at http://x11.s11.xrea.com/ff5patches)
flee + HPcolor + multiSE + optimize + remedypetrified + remember + sworddance
These were mistakenly left out of the release by xJ4cks after getting playtested by Gens for utility and cross-compatibility.

v2.04
fixes bugs introduced in v2.03 (why was I working on this on a holiday?)
