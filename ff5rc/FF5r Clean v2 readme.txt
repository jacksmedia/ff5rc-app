Final Fantasy 5r Clean v2, Dec 2024
-----------------------------------
by xJ4cks, Serity, Gens, Cubear, Inu, Tzepish, HatZen08, clymax, C_CliFF, and others

This project is based on the English translation of "FF5r", crafted by Serity with help from KainStryder and Odym82. "FF5r Clean" provides many new Quality of Life mechanics, 2 nicer fonts, changes Krile’s battle sprites (to include her hidden Job), and features the astonishing "DressCode" work by Cubear that shows all Jobs outside of battle.

Gens helped improve the dialogue font, the menu system, and created options that make this game less difficult and more enjoyable for casual play. These are included as separate patches, and are also bundled together into a new "FF5r Deep Clean" edition!

Special work by HatZen08 enables a "Super" mode with 3 custom Ability slots for every Job, and this comes in two flavors. C_CliFF's "2x ABP, exp, Gil" patch is also included, with an adjustment by clymax. Add both of these to the Deep Clean patch for "Super Double Deep Clean", or use either or both with the main Clean version.

Obviously, the talents of MANY people are leveraged here, and ff5aki is credited as the author of "FF5r". They already gave themselves a cameo NPC, otherwise I would’ve made them one; many mentors and helpful hackers have their own avatars in Tule, as well as some brave players who’ve actually beaten this hardtype version of FFV…

Two small design changes make "FF5r Clean" a bit different from original "FF5r": a new Time spell, and early access to Lix. These can be ignored, or they can provide a slight advantage in this challenging game-– it’s up to you!

Thanks to BladePotato, hakumen99, LilyNo3, and CasualTom for playtesting!

Battle Improvements:
--------------------

    ⦾ Images can stack up to 3 (still 2 per cast or Ability, from Inu)
    ⦾ Force a battle by holding down Start button and walking (only in combat zones, by Cubear)

---------------------
    ⦾ Menu font enhanced (based on an open source font, by xJ4cks)
    ⦾ Dialogue font changed (based on "Sea of Stars", by Gens)
    ⦾ All Jobs are visible on the map (fantastic custom work by Cubear)
    ⦾ Some icons improved (some based on tsushiy's FF6 T-Edition, by xJ4cks)
    ⦾ Krile looks less “chibi” in battle (completely redrawn sprites, by xJ4cks)
    ⦾ Krile hidden Job made to align with other characters’ hidden Job (by xJ4cks)
    ⦾ Custom title screens (one of many features made possible by noisecross’s FF5e_Text_Editor.exe)

Other Changes:
----------------
    ⦾ Lix can be accessed before gaining the airship (by xJ4cks)

FF5r Deep Clean Changes:
------------------------
    ⦾ !Steal rate is seriously improved (by Gens)
    ⦾ Learning is always turned on, for all Jobs (by Gens)

Optional patches, Double & Super:
---------------------------------
    ⦾ Gil, Exp, and ABP increased by 100% from all monsters (by C-Cliff & clymax) 
    ⦾ Change 3 of the Ability slots for all Jobs, not just hidden Job (by HatZen08)

Optional patch for Re-equip:
----------------------------
    ⦾ Changes "Empty" option in Config menu to "Keep", to retain equipment after changing Jobs; this patch makes the Best option a bit buggy, however and it will equip very weak armor sometimes (sell them off if you want to use this optional patch)

Consult the readme files in the optional patch folders for more info.
